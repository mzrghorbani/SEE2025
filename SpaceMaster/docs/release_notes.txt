Release Notes for Space Master v 1.4.13
=======================================

OVERVIEW
--------

Extension of license period for 2023. No functional changes.


Release Notes for Space Master v 1.4.12
=======================================

OVERVIEW
--------

Fixes nonconformance to SISO SpaceFOM v1.0 specification regarding transitions
to EXEC_MODE_FREEZE.

DETAILS
-------

1. Fixed executive mode transition time. Space Master would not transition to
   EXEC_MODE_FREEZE at the scenario time published by ExCO unless this time was
   multiple of 1 second. This problem is now fixed.

2. ExCO's next_mode_scenario_time attribute is now properly expressed in seconds
   since the Truncated Julian Date epoch, as SpaceFOM v1.0 specifies. The
   timestamp was expressed in days before.

3. Minor internal code clean ups.


Release Notes for Space Master v 1.4.11
=======================================

OVERVIEW
--------

Addresses some errors that could occur due to race conditions.

DETAILS
-------

1. Fixed a ConcurrentModificationException error that could occur during the
   discovery of required federates.

2. Fixed a HLANotConnectedException error when transitioning to
   EXEC_MODE_SHUTDOWN.

3. SpaceMaster now disconnects immediately on shutdown when the option
   master.federation.mtr.shutdown=false. In 1.4.10 and earlier, SpaceMaster
   would stay connected until the user pressed a key, which could block
   federates that did not properly coordinate time advancing with the shutdown
   procedure.
